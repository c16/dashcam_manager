## Sprint 1 & 2: Foundation & Video Browser âœ…

**Branch:** master (base work)
**Status:** Complete

### Features Implemented
- **GTK4 Main Window** with responsive layout
  - Header bar with connection status
  - Left sidebar for directory navigation and filters
  - Center panel with thumbnail grid view
  - Right panel for download queue
  - Bottom status bar

- **Video Grid Browser**
  - Thumbnail display with lazy loading
  - Click to download videos
  - Filter by camera (front/back) and type (normal/emergency)
  - Real-time thumbnail caching

- **Connection Manager**
  - Auto-discovery of dashcam at 192.168.0.1
  - Connection monitoring with auto-reconnect
  - Keeps recording stopped during browsing

- **Cache Manager**
  - Persistent thumbnail caching
  - Metadata storage in JSON
  - Automatic cleanup of old entries

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed thumbnail loading bug** after directory switches
  - Root cause: API state corruption when switching between empty/full directories
  - Solution: Call `work_mode_cmd('stop')` before each directory load
  - Result: 100% reliable directory loading

### Test Results
- Directories load correctly every time
- Thumbnails cache properly
- Connection monitoring works reliably
- UI is responsive and smooth
